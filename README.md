# Translator

A real-time translation application built with Flutter that works entirely offline using Google's ML Kit.

## Overview

Local Translator is an open-source mobile application that provides real-time translation capabilities without requiring an internet connection. By leveraging Google's ML Kit for on-device machine learning and Flutter for cross-platform development, this app ensures your translations are fast, private, and available anywhere.

## Goals

- Create a user-friendly translation app that works 100% offline
- Provide real-time translation capabilities for text, camera, and conversation
- Support a wide range of languages available in ML Kit
- Ensure privacy by keeping all processing on-device
- Maintain small app size despite including ML models
- Optimize performance for smooth translation experience on various devices
- Deliver consistent experience across iOS and Android platforms

## Features

- **Text Translation**: Translate typed or pasted text instantly
- **Camera Translation**: Point your camera at text to see translations overlaid in real-time
- **Conversation Mode**: Real-time two-way translation for in-person conversations
- **Language Detection**: Automatically identify the source language
- **Favorites**: Save frequently used translations for quick access
- **History**: View your recent translations
- **Customizable UI**: Light/dark themes and adjustable text size
- **Share**: Easy sharing of translations with other apps
- **Pronunciation**: Text-to-speech for translated content
